# Temporal-Bisection-Task
This is the script used to analise the temporal bisection task data extracted from the JATOS platform. 
The temporal bisection task was developed using the OpenSesame software, the task was designed to be run online, so that the temporal bisection task collection can be done remotely.
The "Example .csv file" is an example of a file extracted from the JATOS platform that was converted form .txt to .csv with the use of the OSWeb tool available in the OpenSesame software.
The "Graph Example" is a result from the code that is available. 
Also in the code, it is possible to extract the Bisection Point, the Differential Threshold (Difference Limen) and the Weber's Ratio from a participant.
